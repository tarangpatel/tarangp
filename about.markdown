Welcome to my blog.

> Documenting important topics in iOS, Swift, ML and technology in general  

I am a computer engineer with passion in photography. My goal is to learn new technologies, document it here as I learn it and share with others.

I have 10+ years of software development experience developing mobile applicaitons for iOS platforms. I love to experiment and build software prototypes such as websites, backend applications, machine learning models and full stack software.

I am open for consulting and collaborating on your next great idea.
