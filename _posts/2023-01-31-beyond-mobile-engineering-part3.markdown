# Beyond Mobile Engineering - Part 3
### *Moving to management* 

## Pivot to Management Path

*Technical to Management*

For those who are looking to move away from the technical path here are some tips to become a mobile manager:

1. **Master of One:** First of all make sure you know your platform, have a very good understanding of your ecosystem, and are able to get your hands dirty when needed. Because to be an effective manager you should know your field.
2. **Network:** Become active in the community. Talk to other people who are experts in the same field. Learn from their challenges and how they approached them.
3. **Be Eager:** to learn other platforms and ecosystems. Maybe at one point, you might need to move from native to hybrid or vice versa. Explore how to perform such transformation, pros and cons, risks involved, etc...
4. **Motivation:** Think at the team level. Every team member needs some kind of motivation. Be it motivation to do their work or motivation to grow and advance in their career. Think about how you can motivate and mentor them.
5. **Emotional Intelligence (EI):** This has gained a lot of popularity in recent times. And in this age of work culture, EI is a necessary skill for any manager or leader. Having the right mindset and control over emotions brings prosperity not only to oneself but also impacts positively on your team.

## Couple of more options

So far I have mentioned the two most common paths for a developer, **Technical and Management**. But there is one more option (or you can say two more). It is the path of joining **Agile practice or Business Analyst**.

*Agile and BA options*


### Agile Practice
The introduction of agile methodology and ways of working opened up new roles of Scrum Master and Product Owner. Though it looks like it falls under management/business, it is not. These roles lie between technical and management.
- **Scrum Master:** SMs are accountable for helping their teams succeed, and that often means offering them assistance in groups or on a one-on-one basis. Often referred to as "the servant leader", the Scrum Master's main purpose is to ensure that the team has everything they need to succeed[^1]. As a technical person, you understand the challenges the team faces, the information they require, and the planning that works. Hence, you are the right person for this role. Also, it is best suitable for someone who thrives to work in a team.
- **Product Owner:** POs own the product from start to end. Provides clarity to the team about a product's vision and goal. Defines user stories and creates a product backlog. Works with stakeholders, UI/UX, and the QA team to make sure the product is delivered iteratively and on time. PO also works on market analysis and strategy of the product. Understand stakeholder needs, customer needs, and market needs to come up with product strategies[^2]. Though this role is more product driven, as a technical person you have insight into the possibilities and limitations from the software point of view. You understand technical terms, and the time it takes to develop and hence can make the right decisions. 

### Business Analyst
A business analyst is a person who processes, interprets, and documents business processes, products, services, and software through the analysis of data. The role of a business analyst is to ensure business efficiency increases through their knowledge of both IT and business functions.
The responsibility of a BA might look somewhat similar to SM/PO in Agile. But there are additional tasks such as identifying business requirements and data modeling which makes BAs role very different.
As part of the Development Team, the Business Analyst is focused on the success of the project. BA’s ensure that everyone is aware of the needs and requirements of the business and the solution, fostering collaboration and communication between the teams/parties involved in the project and, overall, ensuring the project is progressing on track[^1].

In short, 
- The **Business Analyst** is focused on the **needs, progress, and success of the project**, 
- The **Scrum Master** is focused on the **needs, progress, and success of the team(s)**, 
- The **Product Owner** is focused on **product development and market strategy combined with stakeholders/customers' needs**.

Together, the BA, the SM and the PO provide a balance that is equally important and needed for success of the solution. 

## Conclusion
In conclusion, don't get stuck in one place in your career. Stay hungry, stay curious, and break that glass ceiling. Of course, unless you are in a very comfortable place in your life and have no intention of disturbing the balance.

In this series, I went through the possible career paths for a mobile developer from my years of experience. This can be applied to any software developer. Also, these are not the only paths. You should reflect and evaluate your life goals, your family goals, and your responsibilities, and then make an informed decision about what path best suits your situation. 

One major path which I have not covered in this series is that of Entrepreneurship. This is the most desired path for many technical people. It leads to freedom, financial independence, fame, and accomplishments. If you have confidence, the right mindset, and a clear vision you should follow this path no matter what stage you are in your career. 

Happy Journey!
