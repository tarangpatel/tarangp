### *Moving to management* 

## Pivot to Management Path

For those who are looking to opt out from technical part here are some tips as an iOS Manager:

1. **Master of One:** First of all make sure you know your platform, you have a very good understanding of your ecosystem and are able to get your hands dirty when needed. Because to be an effective manager you should know your field.
2. **Network:** Become active in the community. Talk to other people who are experts in the same field. Learn from their challenges and how they approached it.
3. **Be Eager:** to learn other platforms and ecosystems. Maybe at one point you might need to move from native to hybrid or vice versa. Explore how to perform such transformation, pros and cons, risks involved, etc..
4. **Motivation:** Think at the team level. Every team member needs some kind of motivation. Be it motivation to do their work or motivation to grow and advance in their career. Think how you can motivate and mentor them.
5. **Emotional Intelligence (EI):** This has gained a lot of popularity in recent times. And in this age of work culture EI is a necessary skill for any manager or a leader. Having a right mindset and control over emotions brings prosperity not only to oneself but also impacts positively to your team.

In conclusion, don't get stuck at one place in your career. Stay hungry, stay curious and break that glass ceiling. Of course, unless you are in a very comfortable place in your life and have no intention of disturbing the balance.
