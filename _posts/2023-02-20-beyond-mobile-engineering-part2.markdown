# Beyond Mobile Engineering - Part 2

### *Staying technical*

So now that you have choose to stay with technical path let us go a bit deep into it and see what are possible options to explore. 

## Conservative Path

This is a very common path where a developer progresses in one particular field with experience. It is perfectly fine to follow this path if that is your goal. You will get to learn and grow at each step. 

## Exploration Path

Above diagram will help you visualize the possible paths you can explore. These paths are very generalized. You can definitely do Mobile and Backend together or iOS and Mac apps together or Android and WearOS together. Also you can be developing an application which incorporates AI/ML in the app. But the above paths show at what stage you can give complete attention to that stack.

We will look into management path in next article. For now lets focus only on two technical paths:

1. **Architect:** You are master in one domain. You know the ins and outs of how to design, develop and architect an application. Now it is time to look at big-picture. 
   - Break down application into components. 
   - Identify moving parts. 
   - Design and create architecture for new features. 
   - Plan and improve existing architecture, build systems and project structure. 
   - Look into optimizations. Code quality and performance. 
   - As a solution architect you can get to work closely with product owners, business units to analyze and solution new app, new features to convert stakeholders requirements to software. 

2. **Other Domains:** Mobile developers natural instinct is to work on back-end stack. As the consumers of APIs it is always intriguing to see how API works and how can you make it better. Hence learning and pivoting to backend engineering is a natural path. It is a huge field in itself. But there is more to it:
   - Making apps for other platforms like windows, mac, wearables and IoT. This path is still front-end as it is more user facing than the cloud.
   - DevOps is relatively new but very important for continuous integration and continuous deployment of any software. With advances in cloud the need for containerizing and shipping large apps efficiently and securely has increased tremendously. Hence this can be equally challenging and rewarding path to explore. 
   - AL/ML: You actually cannot avoid this. Eventually every software engineer will stumble upon AI/ML at some point. But it is a complete beast on its own. For Python developer it is a natural path. But with CoreML/CreateML and MLKit even mobile developers has chance to go deeper into this field while stay on mobile domain. I will recommend to start from basics as it will give deeper understanding of algorithms and use cases. 

Many developers have the perception that once they go deep in one technology they cannot grow further or will reach a ceiling. But this is not true. There are many different options available to choose from. You can definitely break the ceiling with right knowledge and guidance.

Here are some tips I would like to share from my experience:

1. In early stages of your career try out different tech stacks. Learn a few but different languages. For eg: Make an Android/iOS app and develop a backend for it. This way you will get to know both front-end and back-end. You will know the basics of both Kotlin/Swift and JS/Python.
2. Once you have a grasp of a particular platform explore another one. If you are confident with iOS then learn Android and vice versa. Remember you are not going too deep but only deep enough to know the ecosystem.
3. Every year there is something new on each platform. Explore what is new, try it out. If you cannot incorporate those new technologies at your current workplace or project then make a new project, share with the community and go at your own pace. You do not have to be an expert in everything but knowledgeable enough to analyze and solve problems.
4. Give back: Contributing to an open source project is a great way to give back to the community and at the same time learn from the process. Pick your favourite OSP and make quality contributions. You can give back by teaching and or writing articles like this.
5. At this point you are most probably a senior developer who has worked on various projects, solved varied levels of problems and have a very good understanding of one platform and its ecosystem. From here you can pick two paths:
   1. You can either stay on your platform and explore how compilers such as LLVM works, how build systems work such as Gradle, how can you make something better, how to scale the projects, what is best CI/CD setup, how to make Unit/UI testing effective, Accessibility, etc… Trust me there is a lot more you can do here than you think. 
   2. You can explore any backend tech stack. For iOS developers if you want to stay with Swift, you can learn server-side swift. Vapor framework is an excellent option. Since you already know Swift you will understand the syntax along with how the backend is developed. Concepts such as API, Middleware, Database, Services, Workers will get more clear. You can also look into JS frameworks like Node.js which is very popular for backend applications. Also Python if you have some interest in machine learning. Python is a very general purpose language and I recommend every new and old developer to at least have a good knowledge of it. It is used for the front-end with Django or as a machine learning powerhouse like PyTorch, Pandas, etc…
6. So now you know everything. What's next? Honestly for some, this is it. You have explored a lot and gained a lot of knowledge. Now is the time to implement it. Find opportunities in your current workplace and if you cannot, explore opportunities outside your organization. It is never late to pivot in your career. You can start again from junior but in a very different place. Do not be afraid to start from the beginning. Remember you will progress way faster than you did the first time. You can be a backend developer. Even DevOps. So do not be afraid to pivot. Many businesses tend to pivot in their lifetime to be successful, so can you.

Above tips are mainly for those who want to stay technical but explore other fields.
