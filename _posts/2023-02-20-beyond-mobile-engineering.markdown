# Beyond Mobile Engineering - Part 1

### What does it take to be more than just a mobile developer? How to grow and break that hypothetical "Glass Ceiling"?

Most of the software developer's journey begins with entering one specific technology and mastering it, as time progresses. Though it is front-end or back-end. Some follow the Full Stack path but even in that they master one language such as Java, JS or Python to build full stack applications. Very few developers will spread their wings and go horizontal into learning different technologies as time progresses, gaining broad software knowledge.
Similarly even in mobile application development a new developer will start with either iOS or Android platform. Many eager developers who have prior web experience want to develop for both platforms and take the path of React Native, Flutter or Cordova in olden days.

- C/C++ developers typically explore iOS 
- Java developers will take up Android 
- Java Script developer will take up React Native
- C# developers will take up Xamarin
- Daring soul will venture the Flutter world

Every developer faces with two critical decision points in their professional lifetime:
- Time when they need to decide what tech stack to focus on (which is knowing a going vertical).
- Time when they need to decide what is next for a senior dev like me (which can be going horizontal or pivoting)

## Decision Point 1:

This comes pretty early in the journey and it is not very difficult to decide. A mobile developer will pick one native platform based on their interest and environment, and continue with it. I picked up the iOS platform and stayed in the ecosystem for more than 10 years. It worked for me very well.

Nowadays with more opportunities in React Native and Flutter, many developers decide to go that route. Which is perfectly fine and we actually need those kinds of developers. They bring different perspectives and push the boundary of developing apps for mobile.

## Decision Point 2:

In my career even though I went deep into the iOS platform, I still kept experimenting and learning Android, Xamarin, React Native, and Flutter. This gave me wider knowledge of the mobile development ecosystem as a whole. It gave me a bigger picture when it came to Design Systems, CI/CD, build systems, external tools and services.

With that comes second critical decision point to either stay in the technical field or take the management route. This is very common among the software developer's journey. There comes a point where you have to choose your next challenge. I chose to explore the management path. My reason was to learn what challenges management faces and how it impacts the software development lifecycle.

> Note: You can always move from management to technical and vice versa. In these paths an individual have varied skills and experiences. It allows them to experiment their interests and take on new adventure.  

## Expanding Other Technical Path

Now these are not the only two options at this stage. You have the option to either go deep within your domain, become a principal engineer or an architect who is expert in a specific platform or you can go horizontal and try out other tech stack such as backend.

### Horizontal vs Vertical
Let us take a quick look at what we mean by going horizontal and going vertical. As you can see in following diagram, there are two levels of horizontal paths:
1. Getting broad knowledge of software engineering in general. That means trying different domains. Learning multiple languages. Building different apps, sites and databases. 
2. Getting broad knowledge of a specific domain within software engineering. The means learning how to make mobile apps for different platforms using different available tools and languages.

And then there is vertical path that gives you mastery in one specific domain and platform. 

This is very generalized representation of a typical iOS developer. If you are not a mobile developer still you can see how your domain can fit into this chart. 
In this part we have seen what are the decision points and within those decision points what are the options for a mobile developer. In next part we will go a little bit detail on our decision point 2 and give some tips that will help your decision process.
