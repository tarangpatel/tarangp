I am not sure if AI will steal jobs in the future, but it is definitely stealing everybody’s attention right now. 

Are you fascinated by the magic of ChatGPT and AI in general? Trust me, as a software engineer, this technology still blows my mind whenever I see its use cases, from code generation to making informative videos.

Brilliant minds of researchers, scientists, and engineers have created intricate algorithms weaving  into deep, complex learning layers that have culminated into a brain-like product. This is indeed fascinating in itself.

So, I finally got some time to try OpenAI’s ChatGPT, and the first thing I asked was to write this article. I know ethics and all, but I am only human. Humans will do whatever it takes to improve their life. We have been using machines to make our life easier since the invention of machines; it has gotten only better over time. 

* Google search was the first invention we used to find information online. It changed how we communicate, learn and seek help. 

* Then we got auto-completion. Write a few words, and the machine will suggest how to finish the sentence. 

* The recommendation algorithms used on YouTube, Instagram, Netflix, and others know what we want to watch, read and hear. 

And many more examples like this can go from way before Google till now.

I wanted to see how well ChatGPT generates code. It does a good job at it, but the code is not perfect. And it does not need to be perfect. The point is to give you a start. 

No matter how evolved humans are, we still procrastinate. We often put off tasks until a later date and time. 

The effort that goes into starting something new is often the most difficult part. And if someone or *something* can take that big step for us, we welcome it with open arms and deep pockets. We want our effort to start something to go down. 

AI tools are meant to do those things for us. Performing mundane, repetitive, and exhausting tasks for us. ChatGPT and similar AI tools are currently biased and provide upright wrong information. But nonetheless, they provide a great **starting point.**

## Interesting Projects

I recently stumbled upon the following interesting projects:

### Develop an app

I came across this article, [From Zero to App Store With ChatGPT](https://betterprogramming.pub/zero-to-app-store-with-ai-c7dd73618826), where the author explained the steps for developing an app not from an idea but from the *thought* of doing it. He asked ChatGPT to generate ideas for him. This lowers the process of coming up with ideas which can take days to years. I am still thinking. I should ask ChatGPT. 

### Create a video

Then we have this, [How to Make AI YouTube Videos with ChatGPT in Minutes!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPmGYE38o50&t=691s), which shows step by step process to create youtube videos. The presenter uses **ChatGPT to create a script**, **Pictory.ai to generate a video **from the script, and **Murf.ai to add audio** to the video. Though this makes a good informational video, not a cinematic one, it is still a huge saving in content creation. 

### Sell digital products

This guide shows how to [Create a Passive Income Stream with ChatGPT Ai](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3EYrG8zGWQ). A step-by-step guide on creating digital products that you can sell online to generate passive income. If this works even for a short time, it is worth spending time on because the effort to do has gone down. This is nothing new. There are tons of digital products out there that date back to the infancy of AI. 

Many similar videos and articles show you how AI can help you speed up learning, earn money, and generate ideas.

### Lower the barrier

This information tells us that the **barrier to entry** has been diminishing daily. Anyone can be a creator, and anyone can be a developer. So what about the ones who are professionals? Will they lose their job? 

It is easy to instantly think about the downside of any AI tools because the general public does not understand how to use them properly. 

Sure, there will be a huge burst in content and app creation which can be flat, boring, repetitive, and might give upright wrong information unless there is human involvement in the process of creation. 

## Software Development
>  Developers will no longer have to write boilerplate code, Gupta said. Instead, they can focus on areas such as complex application architecture or cybersecurity. — [Abhishek Gupta, founder and principal researcher at the Montreal AI Ethics Institute.](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsoftwarequality/news/252528379/ChatGPT-writes-code-but-wont-replace-developers)

I completely agree. It takes more to be a great software professional than copy-pasting code from some code generator. 

### Tech debt

Many software products have a huge problem of mounting [**tech debt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt)**. This is inevitable due to the complex hierarchy of decision-making and the urgency to lead the market to capture the customers. 

AI can help reduce tech debt or can help developers focus on tech debt which they never got a chance to do so. 

### Security

With the rise in climate change, and geopolitical and economic tensions, securing 

Many developers don’t know what are [**SOLID principles](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/solid-principles-explained-in-plain-english/) or [Clean architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html)**, and that too after quite a few years of development experience gaining a Sr. title. This is the first thing they should learn.
